# Commit Lint

Just a basic project to learn how to set up comminlint based on the [Conventional Commits Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/fr/v1.0.0/) and implement it in CI with Github Actions.

## Standard Version

I added [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) package to generate automated changelog.
